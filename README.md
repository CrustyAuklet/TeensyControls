# Robotics & RC Control Shield for Teensy3.1-3.2
**Current Features:**
  - Auto power switching between battery an USB
  - Socket for DC step down module (Pololu  D24V series)
  - SBUS input from a generic RC receiver (designed around FrSky XM Plus Mini Receiver)
  - 4 channels of PWM output for servos/motors
  - 4 channels digital switching with high power MOSFETs

A simple integrated design of what used to be a hand etched board with the power and RX modules attached by wires and glue.
This is intended to be a baord to integrate the modules together and provide the PWM and Power Switching features in a rugged
and low EMI manner suitable for encapsulation on a rover.
